This is a repository for a dockerized Xen Orchestra. Built using Bookworm as a base, for Raspberry Pi 64-bit (tested on Raspberry Pi 4 06/02/2026).

Major changes since the last iteration, tends to be very hit or miss whether XOA can run under ARM on a given day. If you are using an Nginx proxy, ensure `http2` is enabled to use V6.  

The image may or may not be updated, though if the repository becomes useful to people I will try to update the build somewhat regularly. 

## Getting Started

You can get this immediately using this docker-compose file. This brings up the service on port 80. For SSL, read on.

```
version: '3'
services:
    xen-orchestra:
        restart: unless-stopped
        image: dustyarmstrong/arm-xoa:latest
        container_name: xoa
        stop_grace_period: 1m
        ports:
            - "80:80"
            #- "443:443"
        environment:
            - HTTP_PORT=80
            #- HTTPS_PORT=443

            #redirect takes effect only if HTTPS_PORT is defined
            #- REDIRECT_TO_HTTPS=true

            #if HTTPS_PORT is defined and CERT/KEY paths are empty, a self-signed certificate will be generated 
            #- CERT_PATH='/cert.pem'
            #- KEY_PATH='/cert.key'
        # capabilities are needed for NFS mount
        cap_add:
          - SYS_ADMIN
        # additional setting required for apparmor enabled systems. also needed for NFS mount
        security_opt:
          - apparmor:unconfined
        volumes:
          - xo-data:/var/lib/xo-server
          - redis-data:/var/lib/redis
          - /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro
          - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
          # to preserve xo-server config on host dir after generated by container
          #- /path/to/config:/etc/xo-server
          # mount certificate files to container if HTTPS is set with cert/key paths
          #- /path/to/cert.pem:/cert.pem
          #- /path/to/cert.key:/cert.key
          # mount your custom CA to container if host certificates are issued by it and you want XO to trust it
          #- /path/to/ca.pem:/host-ca.pem
        # logging
        logging: &default_logging
            driver: "json-file"
            options:
                max-size: "1M"
                max-file: "2"
        # these are needed for file restore. allows one backup to be mounted at once which will be umounted after some minutes if not used (prevents other backups to be mounted during that)
        # add loop devices (loop1, loop2 etc) if multiple simultaneous mounts needed.
        #devices:
        #  - "/dev/fuse:/dev/fuse"
        #  - "/dev/loop-control:/dev/loop-control"
        #  - "/dev/loop0:/dev/loop0"

## Reverse Proxy HTTPS with NGINX Configuration

I'm personally running this with an Nginx container, but the image should support native SSL if preferred. A shared container network is **required.** The docker-compose file for Nginx is as follows:

```
version: '3'
services:
        nginx:
             image: nginx:latest
             container_name: nginx
             volumes:
                    - ./ngconf:/etc/nginx/conf.d
                    - ./ngcerts:/etc/nginx/certs
             ports:
                    - 80:80
                    - 443:443
networks:
        default:
                external:
                        name: containershare
```

Place your signed certificates in `/etc/nginx/certs`. Refer to them under `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`, as below. You will need to add IP DNS aliases your DNS server to accomodate. Create the nginx volume folders _before_ starting the container, ideally create the default.conf to some extent (or copy the below). This configuration assumes the certificates have been created and you have a 404 file present under `/ngconf` or `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf/` or it **will not work.**

```
map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
        default upgrade;
        '' close;
}

server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        server_name _;
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
        listen 443 ssl default_server;
        server_name _;

        ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/certs/raspiserver/raspiserver.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certs/raspiserver/raspiserverkey.key;

        error_page 404 /better404.html;
        location = /better404.html {
                root /etc/nginx/conf.d;
                internal;
        }
}
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name xo.yourdomain.local;

    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/certs/xo/xo.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certs/xo/xokey.key;

    ssl_session_cache  builtin:1000  shared:SSL:10m;
    ssl_protocols  TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!CAMELLIA:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    location / {
        proxy_pass "http://xoa:80/";
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection $http_connection;

        proxy_set_header Authorization $http_authorization;
        proxy_pass_header Authorization;

        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-Ip $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        proxy_set_header Connection "";
    }
}
```

You can modify your docker-compose file for XO to exclude ports, as mapped host ports aren't required under this configuration.

## With Thanks

Project now contains aspects of Ronivay's image and fork from Andrei Telteu's Debian-based image which has modifications to support ARM.
